# bdx #

An indexer and graph generator for binary build directories.

This tool can be used to quickly search where an ELF symbol matching some
criteria is defined in a directory and generate graphs for various queries.

Features:

- Parallel, incremental indexing using sharded Xapian database
- Indexes cross-references by analyzing ELF relocations
- Query the database with a simple query language and custom output formats
- Generate symbol reference graphs in DOT format

## Installation ##

With pip:

    pip install .

Or, for development:

    pip install -e .[dev]

For optional graph generation (this installs `pygraphviz`):

    pip install .[graphs]

[xapian][xapian] is required to be installed on the system.

### Getting Xapian ###

You need Xapian Python bindings, you can get them:

1. By installing [**unofficial** Xapian bindings][xapian-bindings] Python
   package with:

        pip install xapian-bindings

2. By running the provided [install_xapian_bindings.sh](./install_xapian_bindings.sh) script
3. By manually downloading and installing them from [Xapian download page][xapian-downloads]

## Usage ##

### Indexing ###

To index a project that contains a `compile_commands.json` file:

    bdx index -c

Or you can specify the directory to index:

    bdx index -d ./build

The indexer will only index files changed since last run.

The `index` command also accepts `-o`, `--opt` option which can be used to set
some indexing settings, e.g. to disable indexing relocations:

    bdx index -d ./build --opt index_relocations=False

Available options:

- `num_processes` - number of parallel indexing processes (default=same as # of
  CPUs).

- `index_relocations` - if True (the default), all relocations will be applied
  and indexed.  Setting this to False can significantly speed up indexing.

- `min_symbol_size` - (default 1) only index symbols with size equal to or
  greater than this.

- `use_dwarfdump` - if True (the default), use `dwarfdump` program, if it's
  available, to find the source file for a compiled file, if it can't be found
  in any other way.

### Graph generation ###

Generate an SVG image showing at most 20 routes from symbol `main` in
`main.o` to all symbols in section `.text` in files matching wildcard
`Algorithms_*`:

    bdx graph 'main path:main.o' 'section:".text" AND path:Algorithms*' -n 20 | dot -Tsvg > graph.svg

Example graphs: ![ASTAR](./examples/astar.svg) ![BFS](./examples/bfs.svg) ![DFS](./examples/dfs.svg)

By default this generates paths by using the ASTAR algorithm, the `--algorithm
BFS` or `--algorithm DFS` options will use
breadth-first-search/depth-first-search algorithms which can generate different
graphs and can be slower/faster depending on the index and the queries
provided.

### Searching ###

`bdx search` command accepts a query string.  A simple query language is
recognized.

```
$ bdx search -n 5 tree
tree-eh.o: _ZL20outside_finally_tree8treempleP6gimple
hooks.o: _Z14hook_void_treeP9tree_node
tree-eh.o: _ZL22record_in_finally_tree8treempleP4gtry
langhooks.o: _Z20lhd_return_null_treeP9tree_node
langhooks.o: _Z23lhd_tree_dump_dump_treePvP9tree_node
```

The `-n` option sets the maximum number of symbols to search for.

The `--demangle-names` option makes the demangled name available to use in the
output format string.

The `-f` option can be used to set output format (`json`, `sexp` or Python string format spec):

```
$ bdx search -n 5 --demangle-names -f json tree

#### Examples ####

1. Search for symbols having `foo` AND `bar` somewhere in their name:

        bdx search foo AND bar

    or:

        bdx search foo bar

2. Search for symbols having either `foo` or `bar` in their name:

        bdx search foo OR bar

        bdx search fullname:foo

4. Search for symbols where [Elf ST_INFO type][elf-manpage] is `STT_FUNC` or `STT_OBJECT`:

        bdx search type:FUNC OR type:OBJECT

5. Search for symbols `foo*` in binary files named `bar.o`:

        bdx search 'name:foo*' path:bar.o

6. Search for symbols in files compiled from source file named `file.c`:

        bdx search source:file.c

7. Search for symbols `foo` or `bar` that are not mangled (`_Z*` prefix):

8. Search for symbols that reference/call `memset`:

        bdx search relocations:memset

11. Search for symbols by relative path of the binary:

        bdx search 'path:./build/module/*'
